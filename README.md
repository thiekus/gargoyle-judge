# Gargoyle Judgement System
Gargoyle Judge is simple judgement system for Competitive Programming Platform. It was internally developed for INFEST Coding Contest from 2019 to 2023.

Inspired by TOKI's Judgels and other judgement systems. Many unique features has been done that I think not avaliable in other CP judgement systems, such as master-slave model isolation, cache optimizations for scalability, and many more. But on otherside, some basic features were severely limited due to time constraints at the time I develop this program. Nonetheless, this program has served well for 4 years in duty.

This program finally released as open source under Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL 2.0) so anyone can test or develop further. More information and documentation later.
